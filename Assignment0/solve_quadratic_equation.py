    Solve the quadratic equation a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0 using the standard quadratic formula.
    
    This function calculates the roots using the basic quadratic formula without any adjustments
    for numerical stability. It assumes real coefficients and only returns real roots.

    Parameters:
    a (float): Coefficient of x^2.
    b (float): Coefficient of x.
    c (float): Constant term.

    Returns:
    tuple:
    - (float): The first root.
    - (float or None): The second root, or None if there is only one distinct root due to a zero discriminant.

    Raises:

    # Calculate the discriminant

    root1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)
